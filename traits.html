  TRAITS
  </h1>
  <body>
<p>
  Ariana Grande has a good memory, is highly intelligent, well balanced and with strong mental abilities.<br> Her thinking process is logical, and her problem solving skills are outstanding.<br>

While intellectual, creative and with good judgement, Ariana should avoid being impatient with others who are less gifted in the intellect and mental-strength department, or worst yet - looking down on them.<br>

Grande is more intellectual than emotional or practical and her quick analytical brain is capable of abstract thinking, so solves problems quickly and easily.<br>

Intellect-driven that she is, it is important for Ariana to keep her brain stimulated and to challenge herself mentally throughout her life with ongoing learning and study,<br> however - she might also glitch into mental laziness due to lack of interesting triggers in her career and workplace, or in the people that she surrounds herself with.
